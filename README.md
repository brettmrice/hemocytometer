# Virtual Hemocytometer (Phase Contrast)

Each "side" (1 and 2) image show a full 0.2mm x 0.2mm square section of the hemocytometer - perimeter marked by a triple line. Examples of red blood cells, R, and white blood cells, W, are given.

Image is of a body fluid.

The images were captured with an iPhone SE 2nd Gen and further editted in MSPaint.

[Deep Zoom Composer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24819) and [OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/) were used to allow for smooth in-place zooming and panning.

Future Project Ideas:
- Platelet view
- Entire hemocytometer view
- More fluid types (so more cell morphologies)
